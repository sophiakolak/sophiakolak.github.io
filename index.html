	<p>My current research interests are primarily in software engineering and
    artificial intelligence/machine learning. I am interested in
    machine learning for programming, and in studying how real-world systems
    that reason with machine learning can better
    respond to unforeseen events.
 </p>


 <p>
   This past Summer (2020), I participated in Carnegie Mellon's REU
   in software engineering, where I was advised by
   <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> and worked
   alongside <a href="http://kinneerc.github.io/">Cody Kinneer</a> on
   improving plan reuse for autonomous systems with transfer learning. My
   project specifically focused on how self-adaptive, self-healing,
   self-managing, or self-* systems that plan with neural networks
   could use information from past plans to generate new ones. We proposed
   a method for transferring information between plans using evolutionary
   computation, which I implemented on our exemplar self-* system and
   empirically evaluated. The results indicated that neuro-reuse converged to a
    higher utility plan in the majority of trials, and was more robust against
    drastic changes to the system's operating environment (as opposed to
    re-planning from scratch). We described our methodology and results in the
  <a href="files/neuro-reuse.pdf">paper</a> currently under
  review for ICSME `21.
 </p>

 <p>
I also participated in the
<a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software
  Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University in Summer 2019.
  I was advised by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a>
  and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/i">Michael Hilton</a>, and
  worked alongside
  <a href="http://www.christimperley.co.uk/">Chris Timperley</a> and
   <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~afsoona/">Afsoon Afzal</a>,
  studying the Robot Operating System (ROS). This experience led to the
  <a href="https://afsafzal.github.io/materials/KolakROS20.pdf">ICSME
    publication</a> "It Takes a Village to Build a Robot", where we
    mapped package relationships in the ROS ecosystem and discovered
    a small group of influential packages at the core of the collaboration
    structure. I also gave a talk on this research at
  <a href="https://roscon.ros.org/2019/"> ROScon</a>
  in October, and was mentioned in the Open Robotics
  <a href="https://www.openrobotics.org/blog/2019/11/4/roscon-macau-2019">
    highlights.</a>
  Video and slides can be found
  <a href ="https://vimeopro.com/osrfoundation/roscon-2019/page/12">here.</a>
  After my presentation at ROScon, I was invited to participate in a
  software quality panel for the 2020 version of the conference (ROSworld).
</p>

    <p>During my sophomore year, I worked in the
    <a href="https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/">Axel Lab</a> under PI and Nobel
    Laureate Richard Axel. The lab's goal is to understand how the brain is able
    to construct an internal representation of reality.
    In the experiment I worked on, we recorded place and time cell spiking
  activity during a navigation task to examine how mice represent, recognize
  and employ sparse olfactory landmarks to form a cognitive spatial map.
  I used machine learning techniques to identify place and time cells in this
  high dimensionality neuron spiking data, and to correlate their activity with
   behavior.
 </p>

        Another ongoing project is my work with Columbia Space Initiative.
    I am the mission co-lead for Columbia's CS team,
    recently accepted to compete in the
    <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits.cfm">
        NASA SUITS challenge </a>. Our team is designing an augmented
    reality user interface for the Microsoft HoloLens, a proxy for the
    AR-enabled glass that will be present in next generation space suit helmets.
        The UI is meant to help astronauts complete tasks with less intervention
    from Mission Control, in preparation for deep space exploration.
    Our faculty advisor and mentor is professor
    <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/">
        Steven Feiner</a>, PI of the Columbia Computer Graphics and User
    Interfaces Lab. <a href="files/NASA_prop.pdf">Here</a>
  is a link to our accepted proposal: an initial design plan.

		I have always loved teaching, especially in math and CS. Fall 2019 and
    Spring 2020 I was a TA for CS Theory (COMS 3261), and this semester
    (Fall 2020) I will be TAing the class again. This course is an
    introduction to models of computation, computability, and complexity.
    It is highly mathematical and primarily proof-based (the follow up to
    Discrete Math). Over the course of the semester, we were responsible for
    coming up with HW problems, designing exams, grading (lots of grading),
    running recitations, holding weekly office hours, and managing the Piazza
    page. To supplement class material, I hosed a midterm review and a proof
    writing workshop (slides for both are available here!)

      (midterm review slides)</a>

		Prior to becoming a TA, I worked at
    <a href="https://www.coding4youth.org/">Coding4Youth</a>
    where I taught game design in Java, and at
    <a href="https://www.gooroo.com/">Gooroo</a> where I tutored NYC
    students in math.

    Last Spring, I took an amazing course in Quantum Computing. For my final
    project, I proposed and implemented a quantum algorithm for parsing simple
    context-free grammars. Here is the final paper I wrote for the class.

    and student in Machine Learning/Algos.

    Lastly, as a CC student, I’ve taken my fair share of philosophy,
    history and literature classes. Here are some of my favorite papers from those
    classes over the years, and my magnum opus from LitHum freshman year,
    “Columbia’s Inferno”
