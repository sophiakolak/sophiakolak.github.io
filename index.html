	<p>I'm currently working at Columbia's <a href="https://www.creativemachineslab.com/">Creative Machines Lab</a> under the direction of <a href="https://www.hodlipson.com/">Hod Lipson</a> on software for a robotic face that can mimic human facial expressions. 
	  I also work as a <a href="#teaching">teaching assistant</a> for Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261),
	  and serve as Treasurer of the Association for Women in Mathematics <a href="#AWM">https://www.columbiaawm.com/</a>.
	  Last but not least, I am highly involved in  <a href="https://columbiaspace.org/">Columbia Space Initiative</a>, where I helped design and build a EVA tool that we tested and presented at NASA's NBL as part of a nationwide engineering challenge.

      <div id="Research" class="box"><h1 id="" class="boxtitle">Research</h1>
	<p>I am interested in a wide variety of computer science topics, from robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to software engineering and automatic program repair. I am also broadly interested in neuroscience and philosophy of science. </p>
	<p>Previously, I worked in the Axel Lab <a href="https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/">Axel Lab</a> under PI and Nobel Laureate Richard Axel. The lab's goal is to understand how the brain is able to construct an internal representation of reality.
	My project was to investigate how the olfactory circuit in particular impacts our mental represntation of distance, time, and space. Most of my work involved using recurrent neural networks and deep learning algorithms to find trends in high 
	dimensionality neuron spiking data.<br /> <br />
	I also participated in the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University this summer. I was advised by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> 
		and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/i">Michael Hilton</a>, and worked alongisde <a href="http://www.christimperley.co.uk/">Chris Timperley</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~afsoona/">Afsoon Afzal</a>, 
		studying the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our original idea was to understand the state of testing in robotics code, since very little research had been done on the subject. 
		As I collected more an more data on ROS, however, it became clear that just the software ecosystem alone was incredibly interesting and deserved its own research paper. We are currently still working on a paper that details all of our 
		findings, and I gave a talk on this research at <a href="https://roscon.ros.org/2019/"> ROScon</a> in October. Video and slides can be found <a href ="https://vimeopro.com/osrfoundation/roscon-2019/page/12">here</a>!
