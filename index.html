	<p>I'm currently working in Carnegie Mellon's Institue for Software Research, under the direction of <a href"https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/"> Michael Hilton</a> on a robotics software engineering project,
	  modeling and evaluating the Robot Operating System <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> as a software ecosystem.
	  I also work as a <a href="#teaching">teaching assistant</a> for Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261),
	  and serve as Treasurer of the Association for Women in Mathematics <a href="#AWM">https://www.columbiaawm.com/</a>.
	  Last but not least, I am highly involved in  <a href="https://columbiaspace.org/">Columbia Space Initiative</a>, where I helped design and build a EVA tool that we tested and presented at NASA's NBL as part of a nationwide engineering challenge.

      <div id="Research" class="box"><h1 id="" class="boxtitle">Research</h1>
	<p>I am interested in a wide variety of computer science topics, from robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to software engineering and automatic program repair.</p>
	<p>Previously, I worked in the Axel Lab <a href="https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/">Axel Lab</a> under PI and Nobel Laureate Richard Axel. The lab's goal is to understand how the brain is able to construct an internal representation of reality. My project was to investigate how the olfactory circuit in particular impacts our mental represntation of distance, time, and space. Most of my work involved using recurrent neural networks and deep learning algorithms to find trends in high dimensionality neuron spiking data.<br /> <br />
	I also participated in the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University this summer. I was advised by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/i">Michael Hilton</a>, and worked alongisde <a href="http://www.christimperley.co.uk/">Chris Timpereley</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~afsoona/">Afsoon Alleb</a>, studying the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our original idea was to understand the state of testing in robotics code, since very little research had been done on the subject. As I collected more an more data on ROS, however, it became clear that just the software ecosystem alone was incredibly interesting and deserved its own research paper. We are currently still working on a paper that details all of our findings, and I will be speaking about this research at <a href="https://roscon.ros.org/2019/"> ROScon</a> in October. </div>

	<p>Programming languages papers are notoriously hard to read.
	  But that doesn't stop us from trying! Often it can be even more overwhelming when around PhD students and professors
	  who have been studying these topics for years. I started this group because I wanted to create an environment where undergraduates
	  interested in programming languages could learn and ask questions without pressure or fear of judgment.
	  We meet weekly (over pizza of course) and have a fun time figuring out these tough papers together.
	  If you're at IU, <a href="mailto:pkoronke@iu.edu">email me</a> to join our email list.</p>

	  is given in honor of the hardworking Jessie and Beulah Cox.
	  It requires me to maintain a competitive GPA and a part-time job.
	  Currently, I work as an <a href="https://ud.indiana.edu/resources-opportunities/resources/peer-coaches.html">IU Peer Coach</a>.
