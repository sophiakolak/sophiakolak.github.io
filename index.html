	<p>I'm currently working with Carnegie Mellon's <a href="https://squareslab.github.io/">SquaresLab</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/"> Michael Hilton</a> on a robotics software engineering project,
	  modeling and evaluating the Robot Operating System <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> as a software ecosystem.
	  I also work as a <a href="#teaching">teaching assistant</a> for Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261),
	  and serve as Treasurer of the Association for Women in Mathematics <a href="#AWM">https://www.columbiaawm.com/</a>.
	  Last but not least, I am highly involved in  <a href="https://columbiaspace.org/">Columbia Space Initiative</a>, where I helped design and build a EVA tool that we tested and presented at NASA's NBL as part of a nationwide engineering challenge.

      <div id="Research" class="box"><h1 id="" class="boxtitle">Research</h1>
	<p>I am interested in a wide variety of computer science topics, from robotics and artificial intelligence to software engineering and automatic program repair.</p>
	<p>Previously, I worked in the Axel Lab <a href="https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/">Axel Lab</a> under PI and Nobel Laureate Richard Axel. My project was to understand how the olfactory circuit impacts our internal represntation of distance, time, and space. Most of my work involved using recurrent neural networks and deep learning algorithms to find trends in high dimensionality neuron spiking data.  	<br /> <br />
	I participated in the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University this past summer. I studied the Robot Operating System (ROS), originally with the aim of understanding the state of testing in the ecosystem. As we collected more an more data, it became clear that just the software ecosystem alone was interesting and unique enough to study. As a result of much   I will be speaking about this research as ROScon<></> in October. We are also currently working on a formal paper that details our findings in full. </div>

	<p>Programming languages papers are notoriously hard to read.
	  But that doesn't stop us from trying! Often it can be even more overwhelming when around PhD students and professors
	  who have been studying these topics for years. I started this group because I wanted to create an environment where undergraduates
	  interested in programming languages could learn and ask questions without pressure or fear of judgment.
	  We meet weekly (over pizza of course) and have a fun time figuring out these tough papers together.
	  If you're at IU, <a href="mailto:pkoronke@iu.edu">email me</a> to join our email list.</p>

	<p> The <a href="https://coxscholars.indiana.edu/index.html">Cox Scholarship</a>
	  is given in honor of the hardworking Jessie and Beulah Cox.
	  It requires me to maintain a competitive GPA and a part-time job.
	  Currently, I work as an <a href="https://ud.indiana.edu/resources-opportunities/resources/peer-coaches.html">IU Peer Coach</a>.
	  Previously, I assisted in teaching the EDUC-X 152: Mapping Your Future course.</p>
