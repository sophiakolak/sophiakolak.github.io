	<p>I'm currently working at Columbia's <a href="https://www.creativemachineslab.com/">Creative Machines Lab</a> under the direction of <a href="https://www.hodlipson.com/">Hod Lipson</a> on software for a robotic face that can mimic human facial expressions. 
	  I also work as a <a href="#teaching">teaching assistant</a> for Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261),
	  and serve as Treasurer of the Association for Women in Mathematics <a href="#AWM">https://www.columbiaawm.com/</a>.
	  Last but not least, I am highly involved in  <a href="https://columbiaspace.org/">Columbia Space Initiative</a>, where I helped design and build a EVA tool that we tested and presented at NASA's NBL as part of a nationwide engineering challenge.

      <div id="Research" class="box"><h1 id="" class="boxtitle">Research</h1>
	<p>I am interested in a wide variety of computer science topics from machine learning, robotics, and artificial intelligence to software engineering and automatic program repair. I am also broadly interested in neuroscience and the philosophy of science. </p>
	<p>Previously, I worked in the Axel Lab <a href="https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/">Axel Lab</a> under PI and Nobel Laureate Richard Axel. The lab's goal is to understand how the brain is able to construct an internal representation of reality.
	My project was to investigate how the olfactory circuit in particular impacts our mental represntation of distance, time, and space. Most of my work involved using recurrent neural networks and deep learning algorithms to find trends in high 
	dimensionality neuron spiking data.<br /> <br />
	I also participated in the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University this summer. I was advised by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> 
		and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/i">Michael Hilton</a>, and worked alongisde <a href="http://www.christimperley.co.uk/">Chris Timperley</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~afsoona/">Afsoon Afzal</a>, 
		studying the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our original idea was to understand the state of testing in robotics code, since very little research had been done on the subject. 
		As I collected more an more data on ROS, however, it became clear that just the software ecosystem alone was incredibly interesting and deserved its own research paper. We just completed and submitted a paper that details all of our 
		findings. I also gave a talk on this research at <a href="https://roscon.ros.org/2019/"> ROScon</a> in October. Video and slides can be found <a href ="https://vimeopro.com/osrfoundation/roscon-2019/page/12">here</a>! 
	<p>
		During the Fall Semester, I conducted research for academic credit with professor <a href="https://www.hodlipson.com/">Hod Lipson</a> at the Creative Machines Lab. The ambitious and exciting goal of the project was to create a robotic face 
		that could copy human facial expressions by learning from the faces of others. Two MechE students worked on hardware while I worked on software. As this was a massive undertaking with many components, I spent most of the semester building a 
		simulation of the face in C++ using the Titan graphics library. A breif report I wrote on the original simulation's implementation can be found <a href="files/AI_Face_Simulation.pdf ">here</a>.

		Another ongoing project is my work with Columbia Space Iniative. I am the mission co-lead for Columbia's CS team, recently accepted to compete in the <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits.cfm"> 
		NASA SUITS challenge </a>. For this mission, our team is designing an augmented reality user interface for the Microsoft HoloLens, a proxy for the AR-enabled glass that will be present in next generation space suit helmets. 
		The UI is meant to help astronauts complete tasks with less intervention from Mission Control, in preparation for deep space exploration. Our faculty advisor and mentor is professor <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/">
		Steven Feiner</a>, PI of the Columbia Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab. <a href="files/NASA_prop.pdf">Here</a> Here is a link to our accepted proposal an initial design plan.

		I have always loved teaching, especially in Math and CS. Fall 2019, I was a TA for CS Theory (COMS 3261) taught by professor Omri Weinstein. This semester (Spring 2020) I will also be TAing the class again under Milhas Yannakis. 
		Over the course of the semester, we were responsible for coming up with HW problems, designing exams, grading (lots of grading), running recitations, holding weekly office hours, and managing the Piazza page. I also hosted a 
		midterm review that was lots of fun <a href="files/midterm_recitation">(slides)</a> ! 
	</p>
	<p>	
		Prior to becoming a TA, I worked at <a href="https://www.coding4youth.org/">Coding4Youth</a> where I taught game design in Java, and at <a href="https://www.gooroo.com/">Gooroo</a> where I tutored NYC students in math.
