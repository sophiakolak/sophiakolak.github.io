	<p>I'm currently working at Columbia's
     <a href="https://ariselab.github.io/members/">ARiSE Lab</a>
     under the direction of <a href="https://www.rayb.info/">Baishakhi Ray</a>
     on detecting performance bugs in Python algorithms using natural language
     models of source code. I also work as a <a href="#teaching">teaching
       assistant</a> for Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261),
	  and serve as President of the
    <a href="https://www.columbiaawm.com/">Columbia Association for Women in
    Mathematics</a>. Last but not least, I am highly involved in
    <a href="https://columbiaspace.org/">Columbia Space Initiative</a>,
    where I co-led our computer science mission and helped design and
    build a EVA tool that we tested and presented at
    NASA's NBL as part of a nationwide engineering challenge.

        <p>hi
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Research" class="box"><h1 id="" class="boxtitle">Research</h1>
	<p>I am interested in a wide variety of computer science topics from machine
    learning, robotics, and artificial intelligence to software engineering and
     automatic program repair. I am also broadly interested in neuroscience,
      philosophy of science, and CS theory. </p>
	<p>Previously, I worked in the
    <a href="https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/">Axel Lab</a> under PI and Nobel
    Laureate Richard Axel. The lab's goal is to understand how the brain is able
     to construct an internal representation of reality.
	My project was to investigate how the olfactory circuit in particular impacts
  our mental representation of distance, time, and space.
  Most of my work involved using recurrent neural networks and deep learning
  algorithms to find trends in high
	dimensionality neuron spiking data.<br /> <br />
	I also participated in the
  <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software
    Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University this summer.
    I was advised by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a>
		and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/i">Michael Hilton</a>, and
    worked alongisde
    <a href="http://www.christimperley.co.uk/">Chris Timperley</a> and
     <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~afsoona/">Afsoon Afzal</a>,
		studying the Robot Operating System (ROS). We just completed and
    submitted a paper that details all of our
		findings. I also gave a talk on this research at
    <a href="https://roscon.ros.org/2019/"> ROScon</a>
    in October, and was mentioned in the Open Robotics
    <a href="https://www.openrobotics.org/blog/2019/11/4/roscon-macau-2019">
      highlights.</a>.
		Video and slides can be found <a href ="https://vimeopro.com/osrfoundation/roscon-2019/page/12">here!</a>

	<p>
		Another ongoing project is my work with Columbia Space Initiative.
    I am the mission co-lead for Columbia's CS team,
    recently accepted to compete in the
    <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits.cfm">
		NASA SUITS challenge </a>. Our team is designing an augmented
    reality user interface for the Microsoft HoloLens, a proxy for the
    AR-enabled glass that will be present in next generation space suit helmets.
		The UI is meant to help astronauts complete tasks with less intervention
    from Mission Control, in preparation for deep space exploration.
    Our faculty advisor and mentor is professor
    <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/">
		Steven Feiner</a>, PI of the Columbia Computer Graphics and User
    Interfaces Lab. <a href="files/NASA_prop.pdf">Here</a>
    Here is a link to our accepted proposal an initial design plan.

	<p>
		I have always loved teaching, especially in math and CS. Fall 2019 and
    Spring 2020 I was a TA for CS Theory (COMS 3261), and this semester
    (Fall 2020) I will be TAing the class again. This course is an
    introduction to models of computation, computability, and complexity.
    It is highly mathematical and primarily proof-based (the follow up to
    Discrete Math). Over the course of the semester, we were responsible for
    coming up with HW problems, designing exams, grading (lots of grading),
    running recitations, holding weekly office hours, and managing the Piazza
    page. To supplement class material, I hosed a midterm review and a proof
    writing workshop (slides for both are available here!)

      (midterm review slides)</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to becoming a TA, I worked at
    <a href="https://www.coding4youth.org/">Coding4Youth</a>
    where I taught game design in Java, and at
    <a href="https://www.gooroo.com/">Gooroo</a> where I tutored NYC
    students in math.
